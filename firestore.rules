/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Nina 1.0
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with ownership for employee data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /employees/{employeeId}: Stores employee profiles. Accessible to admins and the employee's leader.
 * - /employees/{employeeId}/interactions/{interactionId}: Stores interactions related to an employee. Accessible to admins, the employee, and their leader.
 * - /employees/{employeeId}/pdiActions/{pdiActionId}: Stores PDI actions for an employee. Accessible to admins, the employee, and their leader.
 * - /employees/{employeeId}/meetings/{meetingId}: Stores meeting data. Accessible to admins, the employee, and their leader.
 * - /roles/{roleId}: Stores role definitions. Publicly readable.
 * - /teams/{teamId}: Stores team definitions. Publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of all employees is allowed only for admins.
 * - Access to employee-specific data (interactions, PDI actions, meetings) is restricted to the employee, their leader, and admins.
 * - Roles and teams are publicly readable, assuming no sensitive data is stored within.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow for prototyping, focusing on authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - To avoid `get()` calls, the `Employee` document should contain denormalized role information (e.g., `isAdmin`, `isDirector`) for simpler authorization checks.  Additionally, the `leaderId` is used to identify the leader, which avoids queries.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private employee data is stored in subcollections under the `/employees/{employeeId}` path, ensuring that listing operations on the top-level `/employees` collection do not expose sensitive information.
